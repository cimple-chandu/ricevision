# 🌾 Rice Leaf Disease Detection using Deep Learning and Model Ensembling Techniques

Rice is a staple crop vital for food security. Early disease detection reduces yield loss and promotes sustainable farming. This project presents an advanced system for rice leaf disease detection using deep learning and ensemble learning techniques.

A native mobile app and progressive web application (PWA) have been developed to provide real-time, accessible disease identification for farmers, contributing to precision agriculture and better crop management.

## 🧠 Models Used

| Model         | Accuracy |
|---------------|----------|
| ResNet152V2   | 95%      |
| DenseNet169   | 97%      |
| InceptionV3   | 97%      |
| MobileNetV2   | 96%      |
| **Meta-model (Stacking Ensemble)** | **99%** |

All models are fine-tuned on the **Rice Leaf Disease Dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/loki4514/rice-leaf-diseases-detection) and exported to **TFLite** format for mobile integration.
